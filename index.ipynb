    "- Use tools like Bandit for Python to analyze your code for security issues.\n",
    "- Ensure sensitive data is securely handled (e.g., using environment variables for credentials).\n",

    "Automating the conversion of absolute paths to relative paths can be tricky due to the variability in how paths are used. However, you can write scripts that search for patterns in your code that look like absolute paths and suggest modifications. Regular expressions can be helpful for identifying these patterns. For a more robust solution, consider using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing for Python code to intelligently identify and modify path usage.\n",
