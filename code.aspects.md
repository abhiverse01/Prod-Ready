# Key Aspects of Production Code

When transitioning from development to production, code must adhere to certain standards and practices to ensure robustness, maintainability, and scalability. Here are some key aspects to consider, with details and examples:

## 1. Logging

### Importance
Logging is crucial for traceability and debugging. It helps in monitoring the applicationâ€™s behavior and diagnosing issues.

### Example
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def perform_task():
    logging.info("Task started")
    try:
        # Simulate task
        result = 10 / 2
        logging.info(f"Task completed successfully with result: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    perform_task()
```

## 2. Error Handling

### Importance
Proper error handling ensures that the application can gracefully manage exceptions and edge cases without crashing.

### Example
```python
import logging

def divide_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        logging.error("Division by zero is not allowed")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        print(divide_numbers(10, 0))
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred during division.")
```

## 3. Modularity

### Importance
Breaking down code into functions or modules enhances maintainability and readability, making it easier to test and debug.

### Example
```python
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

def subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a - b

def main():
    x = 10
    y = 5
    print(f"Add: {add(x, y)}")
    print(f"Subtract: {subtract(x, y)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
## 4. Type Hinting

### Importance
Type hints improve code readability and help in error checking during development.

### Example
```python
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

def main():
    result: int = multiply(4, 5)
    print(f"Result of multiplication: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
## 5. Main Guard

### Importance
The main guard ensures that code intended to run as a script does not execute if the module is imported elsewhere.

### Example
```python
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("Alice")
```
## 6. Documentation

### Importance
Docstrings provide clear documentation of functions and modules, explaining their purpose and usage, which aids in understanding and maintaining the code.

### Example
```python
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Adds two numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.

    Returns:
        float: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(3.5, 2.5))
```

By adhering to these practices, you ensure that your code is production-ready, scalable, and maintainable.
